Hello, I'm Suyog Patil, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for network security and automation. My work focuses on developing tools that simplify and streamline complex tasks, allowing professionals to focus on higher-level security strategies.

# Introduction
This repository contains a set of automation scripts designed to facilitate network scanning and analysis using Nmap. These scripts automate the process of running Nmap scans on a list of subdomains, saving results in a structured and readable format. This automation helps identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses efficiently.

# Importance of Automation
Automation in cybersecurity is crucial because it allows for consistent, repeatable, and efficient processes. It reduces the time and effort required to perform complex tasks, minimizes human error, and enables security professionals to focus on analysis and remediation. By automating repetitive tasks, we can ensure more comprehensive coverage and faster response times.
